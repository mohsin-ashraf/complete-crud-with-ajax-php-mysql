# A simple CRUD Application complete build with ajax.
 This is a single page full CRUD application (as for as the front page is concern) with ajax 
 no page referesh no redirection everything is realtime.

# How to run this application
Past the `PHP Ajax` folder in htdocs
make a database named `ajax` and import the `cars.sql` file for the data base 

Go to http://localhost/PHP%20Ajax/

#NOTE :
I have not Followed the Object Oriented approach or good practices in this application
For example I have made connection on every `PHP` file instead of making it in seperate file
I have used same HTML `id` for multiple elements
